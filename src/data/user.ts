  about: `
Hello, World! I am Arjun Katwal â€” a passionate Software Developer from Kathmandu, Nepal, dedicated to creating innovative solutions that solve real problems.

I specialize in Android app development using Java and Kotlin, with hands-on experience building applications that serve the Nepali community. Since 2017, I've published 4 apps on Google Play Store, including tools for date conversion, weather tracking, and utility applications.

I also work as a Web Developer, creating e-commerce platforms and business websites using PHP, WordPress, and MySQL. Currently developing platforms for Fantech Nepal that serve the gaming and tech community.

Beyond coding, I'm skilled in video content creation using Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, helping businesses grow through engaging visual storytelling and marketing content.

Whether it's building Android apps for local markets, developing e-commerce solutions, or creating video content that drives engagement, I approach every project with practical problem-solving and user-centered design.

Let's connect and build something meaningful together!
